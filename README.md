# Learn Python, for fun and for profit

Each computer has different applications/tools installed thus each computer is unique, and even more important, each person thinks differently. Programming is a brain activity and program code is primarily a communication medium for programmers. An efficient way to learn programming is to learn as a team.

If you have any issues and you have tried very hard but still cannot sovle it, please submit the detail information such as your Operating systems, actions you tried and screenshoot of errors etc to discussion forum. You are also welcome to post learning resources, solutions of nasty issues to the dicussion forum.

## 0. Installation and Setup

It is a common practice to start with `0` in programming. This folder has the markdown notes to install and configure your development tools. The notes have links to additional online learning resources.

- [command-line.md](./0-installation-setup/command-line.md): introduction of command line tool. Please read and learn this first if you don't know CLI. It is must-to-know for a programmer.
- [install-python.md](./0-installation-setup/install-python.md): how to install Python.
- [Use VS Code to Develop Python Programs](./0-installation-setup/install-vscode.md): how to install and use Visual Studo Code (VS Code) to develop Python programs.

Eventually you should use GitHub to manage your source code -- it is how the professional programmers manage source code:

- [git-and-github.md](./0-installation-setup/git-and-github.md): use GitHub to manage your software source code.

## 1. Introduction to Programming

The following two files give an overview of programming development:

- [Python Programming](./1-introduction-programming/python-programming.md): how a computer runs programs, programming languages, compiler and interpreter.
- [Program Design](./1-introduction-programming/program-design.md): the software development life cycle, flowcharts and pseudo-code.

## 2. Basic I/O and Data Processing (TBD)

This folder has Jupyter notebooks files that include both markdown and Python code. You can download the files and play with them.

- [Hello World](./2-introduction-programming/hello-world.ipynb): Use `print` to say "hello world" and other simple strings.
- [Variable and Naming](./introduiction/variable-naming.ipynb): a notebook that introduces the variable concept and its naming conventions.
- [Arithmetic](./introduiction/arithmatic.ipynb): perform arithmatic calculations.
- [Reading Input](./introduiction/reading-input.pynb): reading input of different types.
- [F-strings](./introduiction/f-strings.ipynb): reading input of different types.

## 3. Control Statements (TBD)

## 4. Functions (TBD)

## 5. Files and Exceptions (TBD)

## 6. List and Tuples (TBD)

## 7. Dictionaries and Sets (TBD)

## 8. Processing Strings (TBD)

## 9. Advanced Data Processing (TBD)
