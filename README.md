# Learn Python, for fun and profit

This repository introduce you to Python programming. Most people have fun in learning Python and they can make big profit if they have big fun.

## 0. Installation and Setup

It is a common practice to start with `0` in programming. This folder has the markdown notes to install and configure your development tools. The notes have links to additional online learning resources.

- [Command Line Interface](0-installation-setup/command-line.md): introduction of command line tool. Please read and learn this first if you don't know CLI. It is must-to-know for a programmer.
- [Install Python Interpreter](0-installation-setup/install-python.md): how to install Python.
- [Install and setup VS Code for Python Development](./0-installation-setup/vscode-python.md): how to install and setup Visual Studo Code (VS Code) for Python development.

Eventually you should use GitHub to manage your source code -- it is how the professional programmers manage source code:

- [Git and GitHub](0-installation-setup/git-and-github.md): use GitHub to manage your software source code.

Each computer has different applications/tools installed thus each computer is unique, and even more important, each person thinks differently. Programming is a brain activity and program code is primarily a communication medium for programmers. An efficient way to learn programming is to learn as a team.

If you have any issues and you have tried very hard but still cannot sovle it, please describe the detail information such as your Operating systems, actions you tried and screenshoot of errors etc to class discussion. You are also welcome to post learning resources, solutions of nasty issues to the team dicussion.

## 1. Introduction to Programming

The following files give an overview of programming development:

- [Introduction](1-introduction-programming/introduction.md): how a computer runs programs, programming languages, compiler and interpreter.
- [Program Design](1-introduction-programming/program-design.md): the software development life cycle, flowcharts and pseudo-code.
- [Getting Started with Python in VS Code](1-introduction-programming/getting-started.md): develop and run Pythin programs using VS Code.

## 2. Basic Operations (TBD)

This folder has Jupyter notebooks files that include both markdown and Python code. You can download the files and play with them.

- [Hello World](2-basic-operations/hello-world.ipynb): Use `print` to say "hello world" and learn string and comment.
- [Variable Assignment and Naming](2-basic-operations/variable-assignment-naming.ipynb): a notebook that introduces the variable concept, its naming conventions and assignment statement.
- [Arithmetic](2-basic-operations/arithmatic.ipynb): perform arithmatic calculations.
- [Reading Input](2-basic-operations/reading-input.pynb): reading input of different types.
- [F-strings](2-basic-operations/f-strings.ipynb): reading input of different types.
