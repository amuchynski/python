# Learn Python, for fun and profit

This document repository introduces you to Python programming. Most people have fun in learning Python and they can make big profit if they have big fun.

Unlike most textbooks or tutorials, we write this document with an important principle: teaching the professional way of Python programming. "Professional" means the best practices in Python programming used by professional programmers. Following is a short list of best practices we follow in this document:

- Design with test cases before coding.
- Follow the [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and use VS Code PyLint tool to enforce the style.
- No magic numbers.
- Short functions/methods.
- Design, code, test and debug incrementally.
- Refactoring is part of development.

All lecture videos are in [Youtube PlayLists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2uDA5EgdwxcmSHMZ1f4jvw/playlists).

## 0. Installation and Setup

It is a common practice to start with `0` in programming. This folder has the markdown notes to install and configure your development tools. The notes have links to additional online learning resources.

- [Command Line Interface](0-installation-setup/command-line.md): introduction of command line tool. Please read and learn this first if you don't know CLI. It is must-to-know for a programmer.
- [Install Python Interpreter](0-installation-setup/install-python.md): how to install Python.
- [Install and setup VS Code for Python Development](./0-installation-setup/vscode-python.md): how to install and setup Visual Studo Code (VS Code) for Python development.

Eventually you should use GitHub to manage your source code -- it is how the professional programmers manage source code:

- [Git and GitHub](0-installation-setup/git-and-github.md): use GitHub to manage your software source code. [YouTube Video: GitHub and GitHub](https://youtu.be/WUDzf_c2w0I).

Each computer has different applications/tools installed thus each computer is unique, and even more important, each person thinks differently. Programming is a brain activity and program code is primarily a communication medium for programmers. An efficient way to learn programming is to learn as a team.

If you have any issues and you have tried very hard but still cannot sovle it, please describe the detail information such as your Operating systems, actions you tried and screenshoot of errors etc to class discussion. You are also welcome to post learning resources, solutions of nasty issues to the team dicussion.

## 1. Introduction to Programming

The following files give an overview of programming development:

- [Introduction](1-introduction-programming/introduction.md): how a computer runs programs, programming languages, compiler and interpreter. [YouTube Video: Introduction to Programming](https://youtu.be/4jJ9elnDTk0).
- [Program Design](1-introduction-programming/program-design.md): the software development life cycle, flowcharts and pseudo-code.
- [Getting Started with Python in VS Code](1-introduction-programming/getting-started.md): develop and run Pythin programs using VS Code. [YouTube Video: Python in VS Code](https://youtu.be/FMpb1oN5Jew).

## 2. Basic Concepts and Operations

This folder has Jupyter notebooks files that include both markdown and Python code. You can download the files and play with them.

- [Hello World](2-basic-operations/hello-world.ipynb): Using `print` to say "hello world" and learn string and comment. [YouTube Video: Hello World](https://youtu.be/gLDAJiWOmj8).
- [Variable Declaration and Naming](2-basic-operations/variable-assignment-naming.ipynb): variable assignment and its naming conventions. [YouTube Video: variable assignment naming](https://youtu.be/j415LA6XROA).
- [Types and Operations](2-basic-operations/types-and-operations.ipynb): data types and operations. [YouTube Video: Types and Operations](https://youtu.be/HopGmJKTTE4)
- [Reading Input](2-basic-operations/reading-input.pynb): reading input of different types. [YouTube Video: Reading Input](https://youtu.be/5H09F6JFbIs)
- [F-string](2-basic-operations/f-strings.ipynb): format string literals in different ways. [YouTube Video: Formatted String](https://youtu.be/fEGRLW_--Co)

### 2.1 Code Demo

[Turtle Graphics](2-basic-operations/turtle-graphics.md). It is a markdown file. We don't use a `.ipynb` file for lecture notes because the turtle graphics and Jupyter notebook are not integrated well.

## 3. Decision Structure

This section introudce the conepts of control sturctures, boolean expression and three decision structures: `if`, `if-else` and `if-elif-else`.

- [Boolean Expression](3-decision-structure/boolean-expression.ipynb)
- [Decision Structure](3-decision-structure/decision-structure.ipynb)

## 4. Repetition Structure (TBD)

## 5. Functions (TBD)

## 6. Files and Exceptions (TBD)

## 7. List and Tuples (TBD)

## 8. Dictionaries and Sets (TBD)

## 9. Processing Strings (TBD)
