## Problems and Discussions

Each computer has different applications/tools installed and each computer is unique. It is almost impossible for one to know the answers for all installation/setup/use issues. The best solution is to learn as a team.

If you have any issues and you have tried very hard but still cannot sovle it, please submit the detail information such your OS, actions you did and screenshoot of errors etc to Beachboard discussion forum. You are also welcome to post any resources, things you learned to the dicussion forum.

Learn Python, for fun and for profit.
