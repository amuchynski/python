# Learn Python, for fun and profit

This document repository introduces you to Python programming. Most people have fun in learning Python and they can make big profit if they have big fun.

Unlike most textbooks or tutorials, we write this document with an important principle: teaching the professional way of Python programming. "Professional" means the best practices in Python programming used by professional programmers. Following is a short list of best practices we follow in this document:

- Design with test cases before coding.
- Follow the [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and use VS Code PyLint tool to enforce the style.
- No magic numbers.
- Short functions/methods.
- Design, code, test and debug incrementally.
- Refactoring is part of development.

All lecture videos are in [Youtube PlayLists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2uDA5EgdwxcmSHMZ1f4jvw/playlists).

The followin is table of content. It is organzied based on topics, not on a textbook chpater order. As a program, you count from `0`:

## Section 0: Setup

- [Command Line Interface](0-installation-setup/command-line.md): introduction of command line tool. Please read and learn this first if you don't know CLI. It is must-to-know for a programmer.
- [Install Python Interpreter](0-installation-setup/install-python.md): how to install Python.
- [Install and setup VS Code for Python Development](./0-installation-setup/vscode-python.md): how to install and setup Visual Studo Code (VS Code) for Python development.
- [Git and GitHub](0-installation-setup/git-and-github.md): use GitHub to manage your software source code. [YouTube Video: GitHub and GitHub](https://youtu.be/WUDzf_c2w0I).

## Section 1: Introduction to Programming

- [Introduction](1-introduction-programming/introduction.md): how a computer runs programs, programming languages, compiler and interpreter. [YouTube Video: Introduction to Programming](https://youtu.be/4jJ9elnDTk0).
- [Program Design](1-introduction-programming/program-design.md): the software development life cycle, flowcharts and pseudo-code.
- [Getting Started with Python in VS Code](1-introduction-programming/getting-started.md): develop and run Pythin programs using VS Code. [YouTube Video: Python in VS Code](https://youtu.be/FMpb1oN5Jew).

## Section 2: Basic Concepts and Operations

- [Hello World](2-basic-operations/hello-world.ipynb): Using `print` to say "hello world" and learn string and comment. [YouTube Video: Hello World](https://youtu.be/gLDAJiWOmj8).
- [Variable Declaration and Naming](2-basic-operations/variable-assignment-naming.ipynb): variable assignment and its naming conventions. [YouTube Video: variable assignment naming](https://youtu.be/j415LA6XROA).
- [Types and Operations](2-basic-operations/types-and-operations.ipynb): data types and operations. [YouTube Video: Types and Operations](https://youtu.be/HopGmJKTTE4)
- [Reading Input](2-basic-operations/reading-input.pynb): reading input of different types. [YouTube Video: Reading Input](https://youtu.be/5H09F6JFbIs)
- [F-string](2-basic-operations/formatted-string.ipynb): format string literals in different ways. [YouTube Video: Formatted String](https://youtu.be/fEGRLW_--Co)

## Intermezzo 0: Turtle Graphics

- [Turtle Graphics](intermezzo/turtle-graphics.md): introduce the built-in `turtle` module. It is a markdown file because the turtle graphics and Jupyter notebook are not integrated well.

## Section 3: Decision Structure

- [Boolean Expression](3-decision-structure/boolean-expression.ipynb): introduce the control structure concepts and Boolean expressions. [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/BWH6Yj6rUyY).
- [Decision Structure](3-decision-structure/decision-structure.ipynb): introduce the decision structure of if, else and elif. It also covers the important concept of code block. [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/uwuLu6t95ow).

## Section 4: Repetition Structure

- [While Loop](4-repetition-structure/while-loop.ipynb): the while loop and `infinite` loop. [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/42MhKOvWtwc).
- [For Loop](4-repetition-structure/for-loop.ipynb): sequence of data times and `for` loop. [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/OLITHW_gXXo).
- [Continue and Break](4-repetition-structure/break-and-continue.ipynb): the `continue` and `break` statement. [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/oHAa0I1kbow).

## 5. Functions

- [Function Concepts](5-functions/function-concepts.md): function concept, definition and call.
- [`main` and Scope](5-functions/main-and-scope.md): the `main` function and variable scopes.
- [Module](5-functions/module.md): module concepts and built-in modules.

## 6. Files and Exceptions (TBD)
