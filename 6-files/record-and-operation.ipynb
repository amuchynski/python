    "There are many ways to process record data in a text file. Two popular options are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a line as a record: each line represents a record. Use field delimiter to separate different files in a record.\n",
    "- a line as a field: each line represents a field. Use the number of fields to determine the record boundary. For example, for the above employee record that has three fields of `id`, `name` and `department`, three lines form a record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most applications use the method of `a line as a record` because it is more compact and easy to process. For this method, there are many different ways to delimit the fields in a line. The two most popular methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- white space delimiter: it uses a white space character to seprate different fields. The white space characters include ` ` (space), `\\t` (horizontal tab), `\\n` (new line), `\\v` (vertical tab), `\\f` (feed), `\\r` (carriage return). The string method [`split()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) can be used to split fields of a line.\n",
    "- comma separated value (CSV): this is the most common import and export format for spreadsheets and database. Python has a built-in [`csv` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) to process csv files.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, this document only covers the read/write operation of text files that use white space delimiter."
