# Install and Configure VS Code

VS Code might be the best development tool for Python programming and it gets better everyday. Another benefit of using VS code is that it supports many programming languages and can handle many development tasks such as file editing, running and debugging. It has a huge amount of extensions that can do most development tasks you need to do. Compared to VS code, the Python built-in tools are less functional and hard to use.

## Install VS Code

Go to [VS Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) to learn and install VS Code for your operating system. It should be easy but in case you are not sure, you can check the following resources.

- For Windows, follow the [VS Code on Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) or watch the video [How to Install VS Code 2020](https://youtu.be/7yLXtkSsRKE).
- For Mac OS, follow the [VS Code on macOS instruction](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) or watch the video [How to Install VS Code on Mac](https://youtu.be/IATbkNl8qng).

For Mac OS, it is often easy to run VS Code from the command line, follow the instruction in [launching form the command line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).

## Learn VS Code

VS code has a rich set of editing features and it is extensible. You should watch the first five [introductory videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) to learn the basic concepts. You should read most content in the Get Started section.

To learn more, the [User Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics) has detail infomration about using VS Code. It is nice to know.

## Setup Python for VS Code

VS Code has powerful support for Python programming. You need to install the Python extension and configure it to fit your needs. The [Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) document has the setup and basic use information. The [Python Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) has more documents.

For an impatient learner, you can follow one of the following videos:

- For Widnows, [VS Code Python Setup Windows 10](https://youtu.be/Jd4trL90HSw)
- For Mac OS, [Setup Python For Visual Studio Code - macOS](https://youtu.be/veJvQ88ULOM). Please make sure that VS code uses the Python 3 you installed, not the Python 2 coming with Mac OS.
