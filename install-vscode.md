# Install and Configure VS Code

VS Code might be the best development tool for Python programming and it gets better everyday. Another benefit of using VS code is that it supports many programming languages and can handle many development tasks such as file editing, running and debugging. It has a huge amount of extensions that can do most development tasks you need to do. Compared to VS code, the Python built-in tools are less functional and hard to use.

## Install VS Code

Go to [VS Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) to learn and install VS Code for your operating system. It should be easy but in case you are not sure, you can check the following resources.

- For Windows, follow the [VS Code on Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) or watch the video [How to Install VS Code 2020](https://youtu.be/7yLXtkSsRKE).
- For Mac OS, follow the [VS Code on macOS instruction](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) or watch the video [How to Install VS Code on Mac](https://youtu.be/IATbkNl8qng).

For Mac OS, it is often easy to run VS Code from the command line, follow the instruction in [launching form the command line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).

## Learn VS Code

VS code has a rich set of editing features and it is extensible. Click `Help -> Welcome`, you can see the Welcome screen. It has shortcuts to create a new file, open a folder, recent projects and a lot help information.

You should find time to go through the videos and docs in [Get Started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) to learn the basic functions such as user interface, extensions, shortcut keys, code editing, file operations, and settings. Though examples are JavaScript or text files, most operations are the same for other program languages. The more you know about the VS code, the more efficient you will be. You should invest time to learn it. For detail information about a specific feature, check the [VS Code User Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics).

## Setup Python for VS Code

VS Code has powerful support for Python programming. You need to install the [Microsoftw Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and optionally configure it to fit your needs. The [Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) document has the setup and basic use information. You should read the [Python Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) that has more information about working with Python in VS Code.

To see an installation/setup demo, you can watch one of the following videos:

- For Widnows, [VS Code Python Setup Windows 10](https://youtu.be/Jd4trL90HSw)
- For Mac OS, [Setup Python For Visual Studio Code - macOS](https://youtu.be/veJvQ88ULOM). Please make sure that VS code uses the Python 3 you installed, not the Python 2 coming with Mac OS.
