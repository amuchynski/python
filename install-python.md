# Python 3 Installation

## Python 3 vs Python 3

You need Python to interprete/compile your Python program to run it. The first task of learning Python is installing Python in your computer. There are two major versions of Python: Python 2 and Python 3 and they are not fully compatible. Python 2 can not run Python 3 program and vice versa. There are many Python 2 programs but Python 2 is no longer developed, you shoud learn Python 3.

To check if Python is installed in your computer and the Python version, in your command line, run `python`. By default, Windows doesn't come with Python but MacOS comes with an old Python 2. Try `python3` in MacOS. If there is a Python 3 installed, you are done.

## Installation
